# COVID-19_Tracker_SpringBoot

This web application tracks the covid-19 cases across the globe.
The data of the virus is fetched from the GitHub repository(CSV format)which is updated on timely basis.
Scheduled the Service using CRON functionality which ensures whenever the application is launched it retrieves the latest records from the gituhub repository.
I have iterated over the records and presented the total number of cases, new cases and tabular format showing covid information of all regions.
